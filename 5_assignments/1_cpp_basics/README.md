## Question 1
Create a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns and a 1D array of size 9.
Create two functions with the same name for entering 1D and 2D array elements, and another two functions with the same name for printing 1D and 2D array elements, making a total of 4 functions. When printing, print only the elements having index which is multiple of three i.e. (for 1D array index 0,3,6,etc and for 2D array [0][0], [0][3], [1][0], [1][3],etc) 

Hint: Make use of concepts like Namespace for making two functions with same name.

**Testcases:**

Input:
```
Enter elements of 2D Array:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
Enter elements of 1D Array:
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
```
Expected Output:
```
Elements of 2D Array at Index which is a multiple of 3:
1
4
5
8
9
12
Elements of 1D Array at Index which is a multiple of 3:
13
16
19
```

## Question 2
Write a program to find the size of integer data type without using sizeof operator.

Hint: Search about pointer arithmetic.

**Expected Output:**
```
Size of integer data type is 4.
```

## Question 3
Write a program in which you will make a void function to sort the array in ascending manner, this function will take the pointer of 0th Index of array as the only parameter. Also, Print the sorted array.

**Testcases:**

Input:
```
Enter the number of elements in array:
6
Enter the elements in array:
55
20
40
90
82
66
```
Expected Output:
```
20
40
55
66
82
90
```

## Question 4
This is the input and output for a program. Write a programs that does this using Vectors. Make sure to use iterators
```
Input:
6
4 1 2 7 8 5

Output:
Smallest: 1
Largest: 8
```
